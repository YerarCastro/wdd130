                <p> 
                    Hello! My name is Yerar Castro. I'm from Mexico City, and I really enjoy videogames, sports, music, and movies. 
                    I love spending time with my family, whether it's going out or playing together. 
                    I also have a passion for learning about different cultures and languages from around the world. 
                    I am the youngest of five siblings. I served a full-time mission in Uruguay, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, 
                    I was reassigned to the Mexico Guadalajara East Mission. Throughout my life, 
                    I've had the opportunity to live in Canada, Uruguay, Brazil, and Mexico. I speak Spanish, French, English, and Portuguese. 
                    I have a certification in ELE (Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language). 
                    I enjoy playing musical instruments and currently play the piano, guitar, ukulele, and recorder. Currently, 
                    I am on the path to obtaining my Bachelor's Degree in Software Development. 
                    In the future, I aspire to program an AI-powered virtual assistant that helps people practice and learn languages. 
                    I know similar tools exist, but I would love to contribute my unique perspective and skills to this field.
                </p>
